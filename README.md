# about data
I ran a few different models and each one landed in the same accuracy ball-park but an ensemble model bumped everything up to ~92%. There are most likely some non-linear relationships going on here between the variables that increased complexity will uncover. The trade-off with the increased complexity is the difficulty in seeing what's going on under the hood. For a simple data competition, that's not a problem but for a real world application a doctor would want to know how the variables are contributing.
